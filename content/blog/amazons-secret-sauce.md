You know Amazon’s secret sauce?

Kindle.
Prime Video.
AWS.

They all started the same way.
With a fake press release.
Written before anything was built.
That’s it.
You write the story first.
You test it with real users.
You iterate fast.
I love this method because it forces clarity.
If I had known it earlier, I wouldn’t have wasted a year of my life building a website that ended up with 10 customers.

The problem?
Writing your first “fake” press release is harder than it sounds.
Most teams freeze.

So I created a simple prompt (see article) you can test today on one of your current projects.
And to prove it works:
The article below was written by ChatGPT 5.2 using that exact prompt.
Try it.
You might save yourself a year.

### Press release for the prompt:

“Many professionals have heard of Amazon’s famous “working-backwards” method. They know that Kindle, Prime Video, and AWS all began with a press release written before anything was built. Yet very few people actually try the method themselves. The reason is simple: starting from a blank page is intimidating, especially when time is scarce and expectations are high.

To remove that barrier, author François Leborgne has released a simple AI prompt that lets anyone run their first Amazon-style “fake press release” in about 20 minutes, without ever facing a blank page. Instead of writing from scratch, users interact with AI, which produces a first draft they can react to, critique, and improve.

The promise is straightforward. Take a real project you are currently working on. Use the prompt. In one short session, you get a first version of a press release written from the customer’s point of view. Reading it immediately reveals whether the project is clear, useful, and worth your time, or whether it is quietly consuming energy without real impact.

The problem this addresses is widespread. Teams know they should think before executing, but most productivity methods still push people to do more, faster. When they hear about the working-backwards approach, they understand the logic, but freeze at the starting line. Writing a press release “as if the product already existed” feels abstract and uncomfortable, especially alone in front of a blank document. As a result, people revert to meetings, decks, and activity, and stay overloaded.

This prompt changes the experience completely. The AI asks the right questions, proposes a structured first version, and forces clarity early. Instead of inventing words, the user reacts. Instead of staring at a blank page, they improve something concrete. In many cases, the exercise exposes weak assumptions in minutes. In others, it sharpens a strong idea and makes it dramatically better. Either way, time is saved upstream.

“I’ve seen too many people say they believe in the working-backwards method but never actually use it,” says François Leborgne. “The blank page is the hidden tax. Once AI writes the first version with you, the method becomes accessible, fast, and even uncomfortable in a good way. And discomfort is often where the biggest time savings come from.”

Getting started requires almost nothing. Users copy the prompt, open a conversation with AI, and bring one current project. The AI produces a V1 press release. The user then edits, challenges, and improves it. No workshop, no certification, no software rollout. Just one focused session that replaces weeks of vague work.

A project lead who tested the prompt describes the effect: “I’d read about Amazon’s method for years but never dared to try it. The AI-generated draft made it obvious where our thinking was weak. We fixed the project in one afternoon. Honestly, we should have done this months earlier.”

The prompt serves as an entry point to the broader ideas developed in Work less, live better, François Leborgne’s book on reducing overload by choosing work more deliberately. The underlying message is consistent: efficiency does not start with doing more. It starts with deciding what deserves to be done at all.

The prompt is now shared via LinkedIn. Try it on a project you’re currently working on. If the press release quickly becomes clear and compelling, you’ve found something worth pursuing. If it doesn’t, you may have just saved yourself weeks of unnecessary work.

#### FAQ

1. **Is this the real Amazon process?** 
   It is inspired by the working-backwards method Amazon popularized, adapted into a practical prompt for individual professionals and teams.

2. **Why do people struggle with the method today?**
   Because starting from a blank page is cognitively hard. Most people understand the idea but don’t know how to begin.

3. **What does the AI actually do?** 
   It asks structured questions and generates a first draft of the press release so the user can react and improve it instead of writing from scratch.

4. **How long does the exercise take?** 
   About 20 minutes if the project is reasonably clear. Longer usually signals deeper confusion.

5. **Who is this for?**
   Anyone working on projects in a company: managers, individual contributors, founders, marketing, product, operations, or support teams.

6. **Is this a productivity tool?** 
   No. It is a decision tool. It helps decide whether a project deserves time before optimizing execution.

7. **What if the press release is bad?** 
   That is often the best outcome. It means the project needs rethinking or stopping early.

8. **Does this replace strategy or approval processes?** 
   No. It improves them by clarifying intent and value early.

9. **Can teams use it together?** 
   Yes. It works well as a shared exercise to align stakeholders and surface disagreements quickly.

10. **How does this connect to Work less, live better?** 
    The process is detailed in the book : you can reduce overload by making better choices upstream, not by squeezing more into each day.

11. **What is the biggest risk in using it?** 
    Realizing that some projects you’re emotionally attached to don’t deserve your time.

12. **Would you have additional ressources?**
