“Working Less, Living Better” is now available in English!

I am especially proud of this edition, as the illustrator is a 13-year-old boy - **Clément, my son**.

The book is available on all Amazon stores worldwide, in Kindle and paperback editions.

## Illustrations

Here are some of the illustrations drawn by Clément for the book:
